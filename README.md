# Project - data science related projects

***

I currently major in economics and find data science extremely exciting. I enjoy the way data science technique provides me with new insights that I did not notice at the beginning, and I've deciedd to take DS as my career path. This repository [project] records the code I write whenever I finish a data science related project.
